### 1. Receiving Pressure and Modwheel data
Midi Pressure (which is the same as Aftertouch) can be received in three ways, depending on the [System Setting](references/settings_menu.md#aftertouch-type-voice-bend-range):
- Channel Aftertouch on the regular midi channel (applied to all strings)
- Polyphonic Aftertouch on the regular midi channel (applied to the string playing the indicated note)
- Channel Aftertouch on an MPE Member Channel (applied to the string linked to that channel)

Modwheel data can also be received in three ways:
- On the regular Midi Channel (applied to all strings)
- On an MPE Manager Channel (applied to all string in the MPE Zone)
- On an MPE Member Channel (applied to the string linked to that channel)

Whenever Plinky generates a Midi-generated voice for a string, it picks the higher of the two values on that string and uses that as the Synth Pressure value.

### 2. Midi Tuning Standard
Plinky supports *Bulk Tuning Dump*, *Single-note Tuning Change* and *Scale Octave Tuning* (1 and 2 byte forms) as defined in the [Midi Tuning Specification](https://midi.org/midi-tuning-updated-specification). The tuning changes will always be applied in real-time, regardless of whether the command is marked as real-time or non real-time.

**Important:** 

- Midi Tuning can be globally enabled/disabled in the [Settings Menu](references/settings_menu.md#enable-midi-tuning) and is disabled by default
- Midi Tuning pitches are affected by the [A4 Reference Pitch](references/settings_menu.md#a4-reference-pitch)

Behavior when Midi Tuning is enabled:

##### Physical Touches
- Each pad represents a certain semitone. When :P_SCALE is set to a microtonal scale, it is the semitone closest to the pitch on the pad
- For the two pads closest to your touch, Plinky replaces its semitone by the Midi Tuning pitch (if available)
- The position of your touch between the two pads is the interpolation factor
- The resulting pitch is the interpolation between the two pad pitches, using the interpolation factor and :P_MICROTONE

##### Midi Touches
- Plinky replaces the semitone of the Note On message by the Midi Tuning pitch (if available)
- Pitchbend is received as a separate message and is applied as a straight pitch offset

##### CV Touches
###### CV Quantize = Scale
The CV Pitch is mapped to the pads:

- Plinky finds the two pads whose pitches are closest to the CV Pitch
- Plinky calculates the interpolation factor from the distance between the CV Pitch and the pitches of those pads
- With these pads and the interpolation factor, the Midi Tuning is applied as if this were a physical touch
###### CV Quantize = Chromatic
Same as above, but as if :P_SCALE were set to Chromatic
###### CV Quantize = Off
The CV Pitch is used exactly as it came in, Midi Tuning has no effect

### 3. Y/Z Midi Controller
Plinky can be used as a generic midi controller. In this mode the position (Y) and pressure (Z) of each of the eight strings are sent as CC values. Positions on CC 32-39 and pressures on CC 40-47. These values come directly from the touchplate - they are not affected by any parameters and do not use the synth engine. The Y/Z Controller mode can be enabled in [Midi out Filter 2](references/settings_menu.md#filter-2)

---

### 4. MPE implementation
#### Usage
By default Plinky defines the lower zone with manager channel 1 and strings 1-8 using Midi channels 2-9. Using one zone with eight member channels is generally the recommended setup, but different setups with one or two zones can be used if so desired.

Plinky uses per-voice channel pressure and pitchbend by default. Many MPE controllers send CC74 as a third parameter, which controls the Sustain Level of Envelope 1 in Plinky and therefor modulates the level and brightness of sustained notes.

On top of these defaults, any parameter that has a CC in the [CC Table](#parameter-cc-table) can be set by sending it on an MPE member channel. If the parameter is multi-timbral, it will be set for that voice only. Otherwise, the parameter will be set globally.

#### Setup
Use the [Settings Menu](references/settings_menu.md) to enable MPE input and/or output, as well as to set up the channels for one MPE zone.

As prescribed by the [MPE specification](https://midi.org/mpe-midi-polyphonic-expression), two zones can be set up by using MPE Configuration Messages. An MPE Configuration Message consists of the following four CC messages:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **CC 101 0** | RPN MSB | MPE Configuration Message |
| **CC 100 6** | RPN LSB | MPE Configuration Message |
| **CC 6 N** | Data Entry MSB | N = Zone channel count (1-15, 0 = off) |
| **CC 38 0** | Data Entry LSB | Value unused but needs to be sent for a complete RPN value |

These CCs should be sent on the manager channel of the desired MPE zone (1 for lower, 16 for upper).

#### Channel to String mapping (8 channels or less)
- The lower zone starts mapping Midi Channel 2 to String 1 and works its way upwards
- The upper zone starts mapping Midi Channel 15 to String 8 and works its way downwards  

*Example: The lower zone with 4 channels maps Midi Channels 2-5 to Strings 1-4*

#### Channel to String mapping (more than 8 channels)
- Each Zone uses half as many Strings as Midi Channels
- The first half of the Channels map as above
- After that, Channels roll over to fit within the available strings

*Example:*

- *The upper zone has 11 Midi Channels*
- *The zone gets 6 Strings (11/2, rounded up)*
- *Midi Channels 5-10 map to Strings 3-8*
- *Midi Channels 6-15 roll over and map to Strings 3-7*
